## Evaluating Processing Differences Between Tactile and Electrically Stimulated Percepts

Advances in neural technology have enabled control of prosthetics using neural signals; however, users rely solely on visual feedback to confirm movement. Itâ€™s been shown that sensory feedback is critical for precise motor control. By electrically stimulating the sensory cortex through direct electrical stimulation, we can provide sensory feedback to the user and create artificial percepts. New research has found that subjects have slower reaction times when experiencing artificial percepts versus tactile touch, suggesting that the processing of these two phenomena are different. Here, we take a closer look at electrocorticography (ECoG) signals recorded during natural haptic touch and various sensory stimulation conditions. After extracting features including frequency band powers and spike related activity, we train a random forest classifier that reaches 98.9% accuracy on classifying between various stimulation conditions. By looking at model weights, we observe what features are the most defining: the number of spikes in the signal and the distance between the spikes. Our results give a foundation to work towards understanding the mechanism of sensory stimulation for application in motor prosthetic use.
